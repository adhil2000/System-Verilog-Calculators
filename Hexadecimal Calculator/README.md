This will be a two-part design lab, in which you will implement a hexadecimal calculator for the first part, and modify it to build a BCD calculator for the second one. A hexadecimal calculator (within the scope of ECE 270) is a device that can add and subtract two numbers (which can be of the form 0-F) resulting in a number that can also be displayed in hex. A BCD calculator, on the other hand, functions like a regular calculator in that it will make calculations only using the digits 0-9.

For the hexadecimal calculator, you will implement a number entry system (similar to that of the lock) which will accept two numbers, each up to a length of 8 digits only. After entering the first number, you can either add (using the Z button) or subtract (using the Y button), then enter the second number. After that, pressing W (which will be effectively the = button on a calculator) will perform the requested operation (add or subtract).
